## Open source code for Arduino Uno R3 using DHT-22 Temp / RH and FC-37 raindrop sensors as a plant disease ecology datalogger.

Datalogger uses sleep/wake cycle to save power and logs at interval of choice.
The unit also uses DfRobot's solar power manager and 3.5W solar panel to maintain power for extended periods in the field.
